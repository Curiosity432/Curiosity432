- 👋 Hi, I’m @Curiosity432
- 👀 I’m interested in blogging about science, computing, photography, music, designer and much more
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make a blog-site (in various langugages) with md format and without backend (no database)
- 💞️ I’m using the blogging workflow: Obsidian.md (for notes and 2nd brain) + GitHub (repository) + Netlify (hosting platform)
