- 👋 Hi, I’m @Curiosity432
- 👀 I’m interested in blogging about science, computing, photography, music, designer and much more
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make a SSG (Static Site generator) blog written in markdown format
- 💞️ I’m using this workflow: an IDE (Atom.io / Obsidian.md (for markdown) / VS Code) + repository site (GitHub) + hosting services (Netlify) with the framework HUGO
